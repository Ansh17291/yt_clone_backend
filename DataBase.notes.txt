We first always start with data modeling , how the db should look like then move ahead


1. creat a file named .. user.model.js where we store the db model .. hence .model 
2. install mongoose and go ahead to write the models 
3. mostly consider every attribute of the database as an object 
4. When we want to reference a model to another we need 2 things .. 1. type and 2. ref 
e.g. type : mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
     ref : "Users"


There is one more type named enum :[" " , " " ,  " "] .. here the attribute can take any of the one value form the enum array
